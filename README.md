# COVID-19 DATA EXPLORATION

The purpose of this project is to analyze COVID-19 dataset on deaths and vaccinations. The outcome of the analysis helps us to understand following key findings:

1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths
2. Countries with highest infection rate compared to population
3. Continent with the highest death count


## DATA SOURCE: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


## DATA CLEANING & TRANSFORMATION (SQL)

The original data source in csv format was extracted using SQL for data exploration. The relevant tables needed for visualization were created using queries as follow:

The queries were then converted to excel tables and loaded into Power BI for visualization.
